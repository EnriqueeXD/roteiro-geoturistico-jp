    <h1>Definition</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">Often, geotourism has been framed in ecotourism, due to its natural bias and its conservationist character (BRILHA, 2005; NEWSOME and DOWLING, 2006). Throughout history, several definitions have been proposed about ecotourism, which despite the differences, are unanimous in characterizing it as a segment of nature tourism [1], being an activity performed in natural areas, with the aim of admiring and enjoying the landscape, in a sustainable way, sometimes including the study of the elements of fauna and flora (CEBALLOS-LASCURAIN, 1987; TULIK, 1993; PIRES, 2000; EAGLES, 2001, among others). The participation of the local community in this process is essential.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">The Ministry of Tourism [2], in Brazil, considers some options for tourist activities in the country, such as cultural tourism, study and exchange tourism, sports tourism, fishing tourism, nautical tourism, adventure tourism, sun tourism and beach, business and event tourism, rural tourism, health tourism and ecotourism, without making reference to geotourism, which is considered to be inserted in ecotourism.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">Geotourism, on the other hand, has some advantages over ecotourism, such as not being restricted to seasonality, which can develop throughout the year; not be dependent on fauna habits; as it is a niche tourism, there is no overcrowding; it serves as a complement to traditionally tourist areas and promotes handicrafts linked to the elements of geodiversity (BRILHA, 2005). It is added that, in an urban environment, geotourism ends up intertwining cultural heritage with elements of geodiversity or even geopatrimony, in the form of rocks, relief, water resources and soil, which enriches the tourist experience.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">The first signs of tourist motivations towards the knowledge of geopatrimony date back to 1860, especially geology and geomorphology (McFARLANE, 2005). According to the author, Professor Willian Turl offered his geoscientific knowledge to tourists who were interested in deepening their understanding of petrology in European mountainous areas.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">The introduction of the definition of 'geotourism' ended up guiding two major positions on the subject in the academic community: a restricted view, such as that of Hose (1995), where most of the time the prefix 'geo' was synonymous with geological or, in the maximum, geomorphological, restricting this activity to natural / rural areas, such as geoparks and excluding urban areas. Followers of this trend are Newsome and Dowling (2006), Ruchkys (2007), Moreira (2008), among others. And, based on the concept proposed by National Geographic (2001 apud Stueve et al., 2002), a broad, holistic and more comprehensive view of the landscape was launched, focused not only on the natural landscape but also on the culture of the areas in which it develops , expanding the assets of the destination. The definitions of Buckley (2003), Newsome and Dowling (2010), the Declaration of Arouca (2011), among others, stand out. This broader view of the activity will be followed in this thesis, whose definition will be proposed below. The two different positions are summarized in table 4.1, with their main characteristics.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">According to the definitions presented above, most of the geotouristic activity occurs in geoparks, that is, with great interaction with the biotic environment. However, as seen so far, we can highlight the geotouristic potential of other spaces, such as coastal regions and urban areas, which can also serve as a stage for the performance of geotourism. Whether in urban, rural or other areas, the displacement of people through pre-defined trails or routes becomes an important means of contact and appreciation with the surrounding physical environment.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">The existence of Interpretative Trails (MOREIRA, 2011) assigns a new function to the routes, now from a geotouristic point of view, by enriching the experience of tourists, who come to know the natural heritage, especially the abiotic, and cultural heritage in another light , in addition to promoting environmental awareness. These routes can be personalized (guided trails) or non-personalized (self-guided, with the help of folders, maps, among other means). In turn, promoting the understanding of landscape reading, the interpretation of how the establishment of city ​​on the physical substrate, the occupation of urban space and the challenges imposed by the physical environment for this, allow to understand urban geotourism in a broad sense. It should be noted that urban geotourism becomes a complement to routes already consolidated, usually in the Historical Centers of the main tourist cities, through the addition of this new information.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">After all, rocks have minerals, textures and structures that make it possible to tell the history of the planet, in addition to being sources of information about the technological, social and economic past of people who used these geo-resources in the construction of these constructions (STERN et al., 2006) . Landforms, water and pedological resources are other elements of geodiversity that are conditions for urban settlement and expansion and, as such, can also be used in the context of urban geotourism.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">Hose (2000) considers Rochdale Cemetery, Lancashire County, England, as the precursor to urban geotourism, in 1881, whose visitors had access to 30 small rock pillars that told the story of the creation of the Earth from the perspective of Geology. However, in modern scientific circles, discussions about urban geotourism are quite recent, especially since the mid-2000s, and in an extremely inferior dimension when compared to non-urban areas.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">In Europe, urban routes that include the geological and geomorphological aspects, mainly, are very common in the scientific environment, such as London (ROBINSON, 1982), Zaragoza (CARRILLO and GISBERT, 1993), the dissemination of ex-paleontological sites in Lisbon (SILVA and CACHÃO, 1998; SILVA, 2009), Segovia (DÍEZ-HERRERO et al., 2011), Lisbon (RODRIGUES et al. 2010, 2011a; CAETANO et al., 2011), among others. The disclosure of these routes to tourists would insert the activity of urban geotourism in these cities.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">In this thesis, Geotourism will be defined as an activity that is located at the interface of nature tourism, in the case of ecotourism, and cultural tourism, always with knowledge as the main motivation. It can develop both in environments where natural aspects prevail and in urban environments, disseminating and promoting geodiversity and its geopatrimony, in a more restricted sense or its relationship with civilizations and cultures, in a broader sense, in a sustainable way. It consists of adding geopatrimony to tourist activity, focused on places of geotouristic interest, benefiting local communities and giving visitors a new tourist experience.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">Thus, geotourism, be it urban or rural / natural, involves three major elements that intertwine: geopatrimony, territory and tourism, and geopatrimony, the object in question, is inserted in a certain territory, in which promotion and the development of tourism activity is the result of the joint action of managers (public authorities), tourist agencies, tourists, academics and the local community, each of whom has a fundamental role in this activity (figure 4.1).</p><br>
        <a href="media/esquema2final.jpg" ><img src="media/esquema2final.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a><br>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Fig 4.1</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">The touristization process consists of the implantation or development of the tourist activity in tourist spaces or with potential for tourism (CRUZ, 2000). In this way, geotourism has the capacity to touristify geopatrimony, through the territorialization of this activity in specific places, as long as this geopatrimony shows undeniable value for tourism use. The problem is that, often, geodiversity and its geopatrimony are not properly valued, even when loaded with a potential that makes them unique.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">Thus, it is the role of the academic environment to develop methods to assess and select the most interesting sites for the practice of geotourism, as well as to develop tools that allow knowledge of the geology, geomorphology, hydrology and pedology of the place, to disseminate to visitors, tourists . Geotourism combines leisure and scientific-cultural education, enabling the enhancement and generation of new attractions aimed at geopatrimony (CUNHA, 2013).</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:4em;">Public authorities have an essential role in promoting strategies for planning, managing, monitoring and disseminating geopatrimony and geotourism, in partnership with private entities, universities, the local community, research centers, cooperatives in the area, among other bodies, whose ( re) spatial planning, with actions and reactions to appropriation, is a natural consequence. Thus, thinking of natural and coastal areas, geotourism works as a mechanism for the development of a sustainable activity, contributing to geoconservation and the dissemination of its geopatrimony, improving the quality of life of the population, generating funds, through the attribution of new values ​​and meanings for the area where it develops; thinking of urban areas, especially in historic centers, geopatrimony is intertwined with cultural heritage, encouraging the sense of cultural identity, by increasing the awareness of the local population and visitors to these heritage sites, who see the buildings of the Historic Center and the landscape that surrounds it with a new look.</p>
